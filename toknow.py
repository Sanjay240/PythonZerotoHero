# Important
# if a list contain another list inside and to go through each element of the lists with for loop see the example below
# mylist = [["sanjay", 24, 1997],["kulu", 22, 1999], ["balu", 24, 1998]]

# for name, age, year in mylist:
#     print(name,"age is: ", (age)," year born in ",year)
    
    
# break and continue use in the loops the while loop 

# Short hand if - one liners code
a = 8
b = 9
print(" B is greater than a") if (b>a) else print("A is greateer than B")
